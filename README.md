# FA18-Controls
Circuit Python to Control Flight Controls and Indicators on FA-18 Simulator

This was a project to use a Circuit Playground Express to both control manual switches and use the NeoPixels as indicators for various control states, e.g. when twisting a physical switch on the console, it would send a keyboard command to the simulator and then light an indicator light on the CPX.
